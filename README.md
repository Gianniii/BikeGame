## Project Description

In this project we were tasked with creating a bike game in java using a simplyfied version of a 2D game physics engine ```JBox 2D```.
We were free to add as many features as we liked to the game.
In this game you play as an animated 2D bike rider throughout 3 levels with different obstacles more or less challenging and simple enemies.


## How to play 

You can find the main program in *main/java/.../Program.java*.
Executing this program will launch the game in a pop up window.

### Controls: 
- **Up** arrow: Accelerate 
- **Down** arrow: Brake
- **Right** and **Left** arrows to balance the bike (rotate forward or backward while in the air)
- **Space Bar** to change direction. 
- **S** to skip level 
- **R** to restart. 
- **P** to pause (while in pause can move camera with arrows and place a solid crate with space(usefull for the last level))

## Dependencies
Must have java installed.

## Skills
Java, JBox 2D, Object Oriented Programming, Game Design, simple 2D player animation.
